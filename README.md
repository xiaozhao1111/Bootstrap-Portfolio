# bootstrap-portfolio
Build my portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework in this project.

## Description
In this project, a portfolio page is created to show my skills of Frontend webpage design. New projects will be added in the future as the my study goes on.

This webpage has the following main features.
* A header built with Bootstrap Navbar components. The Navbar has my photo and name at the left side, and the three links at the right side. The three links, i.e. 'About me', 'Work' and 'Contact me' can navigate to the appropriate sections.

* A hero section has my sologan.

* "About Me" and "Contact Me" section in the same row.

* A section displaying my work in grid. Use bootstrap cards for each project with a brief overview of the work. Use the button in the card to open the webpages.

* A skill section listing out the skills to learn from the bootcamp.
